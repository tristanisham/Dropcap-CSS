# Dropcap-CSS
A collection of CSS dropcap styles.

## What is Dropcap CSS?
I used to have this project called [The Annotation](https://theannotation.com), a publication that was part of Medium's early publications process, and while I was building it I realized there really wasn't an easy way to create drop caps. Obviously, not in Medium becasue, let's face it, they're locked in with their design, but in general. Why aren't drop caps more generally supported. They're beautiful pieces of art that deserve to be recognize! They spread a publications brand, add flair, and simply at times are stunning, so I decided to cook up a few CSS/SVG publication designs and throw them into a css file. 

## How does it work?

Just download/pull the css file, or use the sketch file attached to customize your dropcaps even more! 
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="dropcap.css">
```
All of the styles are *classes*, and currently I'm working on the naming structure. Right now though, if you want to impliment a style, the basic format is:
```.dc-yourdesiredstyle ```.
